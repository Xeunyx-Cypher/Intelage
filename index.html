      <h1>Intelage Calculator</h1>
      <p class="comingsoon">Coming Soon!</p>
      <p class="description">
        I'm currently learning HTML and yet to start learning JavaScript. So
        once I've learned enough of JS to complete this, I'll complete this
        project! <em>pinky promise ;)</em>
      </p>
      <div class="proinfo">
        üî∂ <strong><em>What does the name mean?</em></strong
        ><br />
        <br />
        The part <strong>Intel</strong> came from the word
        <em>Intelligent</em> and well the part <strong>age</strong> means
        <em>Age</em>. Yeah I know it sounds dumb! Or maybe it
        <strong>doesn't!?</strong> And I guess you probably already know what
        <strong>Calculator</strong> means.<br />
        <br />
        üî∂ <strong><em>So a calculator! What's New about it?</em></strong
        ><br />
        <br />
        Well it's not your normal calculator that you daily use for doing maths
        and calculations. It's a <strong>Special Calculator</strong> for
        calculating stuffs related to your <em>age</em> as the name suggests.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>‚ú¥Ô∏è It'll be able to :</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Tell your exact age based on your input</li>
          <li>Your next birthdate with countdowns</li>
          <li>How many hours you've slept</li>
          <li>How many hours you'll probably sleep</li>
          <li>How many breaths you've taken around</li>
          <li>How much foods you've taken around</li>
          <li>
            How many times your heart has beaten around and all other sorts of
            fun stuffs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p
